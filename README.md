## Abstract
Titles: _Winning is not Enough_ _Winning makes you lose_

The English Premier League is the foremost soccer competition in the world, but is dominated by the wealthiest clubs. It has become increasingly difficult for clubs outside of this group to translate sporting success into a longer term, sustainable challenge of the league’s elite. Winning, it seems, is not enough. How do mid-table premier league teams compete when winning does not guarantee success? How do they tread the line between the glory of a trophy or high-table finish and the threat of relegation? More broadly, how can those with limited resources compete in a system that does not favor them?

How do mid-table premier league teams compete when winning does not guarantee success? How do they tread the line between the glory of a trophy or high-table finish and the threat of relegation? More broadly, how can those with limited resources compete in a system that does not favor them? This thesis will focus on the financial and sporting strategies of England’s mid-table clubs in the past decade. In particular, this thesis will focus on the “three B’s” of the modern premier league - Brighton, Brentford, Bournemouth (smaller clubs with lower following/financial backing who have used a combination of smart recruitment and investment to challenge far above their wage bills), the “wealthy challengers” - Aston Villa and Newcastle United, the “recently victorious” - West Ham, Crystal Palace, and the “fallen giants” - Everton, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United. Profiling these clubs will illustrate the many strategies used by clubs to compete in this congested competition, and determine which profiles have been the most successful.
  
I will use financial (wage bill, transfer fees, prize money/earnings, and profit and sustainability regulations) and sporting (season to season league table position/trophies won, number of games played, and overview statistics like xG and xGA) data to build profiles of the aforementioned clubs over the last 10 years. These profiles will be the basis of comparison to determine which strategies have been overall successful, and which have not. I will note that these profiles are currently based off of media narrative/end-of-season results from the last 10 or so years - it’s not entirely clear how the data will or will not align with these binned categories.   
  
Inspired by the writings of The Athletic and books like Soccernomics, this thesis is primarily aimed at an audience interested in the business and history of soccer. Specifically, the recently-published article Mid-tier Premier League clubs and the awkward art of reinvention on the Athletic is an inspiration. While a soccer-interested audience is the main focus, this thesis will be generalized towards anyone interested in business or strategy with its focus on situations where “winning” does not guarantee sustainable, future success.

## Introduction
(Note: academic articles/books are a little harder to come by for this topic. I have Soccernomics being sent to the library but otherwise there is more work to be done in terms of fact-finding. A lot of academic articles/books do not cover the period of time I’m talking about. I have to lean on journalistic sources.)

The English Premier League is the foremost football competition in the world. The league consists of a twenty-team table: teams higher up on the table take in more prize and tv revenue than those below, and the teams that finish in the bottom three spots are relegated to the league below. Most attention is focused on the “big six” clubs - Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur - that outstrip the rest of the league in financial ability and popularity. A rotating cast of clubs vie for spots 7 through 17 in the table, jockeying for European qualification, better prize money, and the chance to break into the ever-crowded top 6 position. In 2015-2016, relegation favorites Leicester City won the league in an incredible, odds-defying season, making Leicester only one of two non-big six clubs to win the Premier League in its 33-year history. Despite their success - and second trophy (FA Cup, secured in 2021) - as of spring 2026 they languish near the bottom of England’s second tier, stripped of playing talent and facing financial hardship. Non-big-six clubs in similar situations - having won their first trophy, earned their first qualification for Europe, or performed significantly above expectations - face similar challenges turning their success into more success. They risk running afoul of profit and sustainability regulations (PSR), having their best players poached by larger clubs, or fixture congestion running them into the ground. Winning, it seems, is not enough.

Football, generally, is the business of losing money: few if any football clubs worldwide are able to turn a profit (Simon and Szymanski, 2022). Unfortunately, to sustain a challenge higher up the table - and to turn that challenge into sustained, elite performance - a lot of money is needed. Examples include the rise of Chelsea and Manchester City in the modern day, clubs that were transformed into the elite through vigorous and sometimes illegal injections of money, mainly at a loss. The introduction of Profit and Sustainability Regulations in the 2013/14 season made this practice strategy much more difficult: these rules limit a club’s financial losses and owner injections, with sporting and transfer penalties applied to those who do not comply. As much as modern clubs have tried - Newcastle United with the Saudi takeover in 2021 - it is much harder to buy your way to the top.

Clubs in lower financial brackets have found alternative ways to compete in this league. These clubs traditionally have smaller fanbases and smaller revenues than historically dominant clubs, but can challenge further up the table using intelligent player recruitment, sales, and strategic investment. Primary modern day examples include Brighton and Hove Albion, Brentford FC - the “moneyball” clubs of the league - as well as AFC Bournemouth and Southampton FC. While exact strategies differ, a common point of success between these clubs is intelligent player recruitment and sales - bringing in promising players for low fees and wages, developing them into superstars, and selling them for significant profit (keeping the clubs financially sustainable and allowing for further investment). When these strategies falter, the clubs can falter as well: Southampton was convincingly relegated to the second division in both the 2022/23 and 2024/2025 seasons. Their dropoff in player recruitment as they tried to establish themselves as a premier league mainstay has been identified as a key failing (Madeley and Weatherspoon, 2026).

Intelligent player recruitment needs to be coupled with sporting success. Sporting success increases the value of recruited players and raises the popularity of the club for fans and potential recruitments alike, which can lead to higher long term revenue. These clubs are always selling clubs - their model is built on turning players into profit - but the sales of the best players can make teams less competitive. The balance is tricky, with a need for continuous sporting success coupled with the loss of the core driver of that success - high quality football players. Some clubs have managed this transition better than others (Naylor 2023) but many have failed on this journey. Football is a game dominated by the biggest players, and smaller teams who experience success are consistently raided for their best and brightest. In such an environment, these teams must always perform beyond expectations and financial realities or risk relegation.

This paper will analyze clubs using sporting and financial data from the last 10 years in the premier league, starting with Leicester City’s success in the 2015/16 season. Data will be collected on the level of individual teams per season. Sporting data will focus on cumulative goals scored, conceded, expected goals and goals conceded (Mead et al. 2023), and contextualizing data (trophies, upsets, team form, club firsts, etc). Financial data will focus on player transfer fees (both incoming and outgoing), wage bill, revenue/financial losses, and compliance with financial sustainability and fair play rules (PSR and related rules). These data are unfortunately less available than they were a few months ago, but have been tracked and aggregated by a variety of sources for the modern existence of the Premier League.
	Data will be used to build “data profiles” of teams of interest, namely Brighton, Brentford, Bournemouth, Southampton, Leicester, Aston Villa, Newcastle United, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Everton, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United. These clubs are or have been in the Premier League for a majority of the decade of interest, and represent the breadth of successes and struggles facing mid-table clubs. This paper will compare profiles to uncover which practices are best suited for establishing long-term success in the mid table of the Premier League.
