## Abstract
Titles: _Winning is not Enough_ _Winning makes you lose_

The English Premier League is the foremost soccer competition in the world. The league consists of a twenty-team table: teams higher up on the table take in more prize and tv revenue than those below, and the teams that finish in the bottom three spots are relegated to the league below. Most attention is focused on the “big six” clubs - Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur - that outstrip the rest of the league in financial ability and popularity. A rotating cast of clubs vie for spots 7 through 17 in the table, jockeying for European qualification, better prize money, and the chance to break into the ever-crowded top 6 position. In 2015-2016, relegation favorites Leicester City won the league in an incredible, odds-defying season, making Leicester only one of two non-big six clubs to win the Premier League in its 33-year history. Despite their success - and second trophy (FA Cup, secured in 2021) - as of spring 2026 they languish near the bottom of England’s second tier, stripped of playing talent and facing financial hardship. Winning, it seems, is not enough.

How do mid-table premier league teams compete when winning does not guarantee success? How do they tread the line between the glory of a trophy or high-table finish and the threat of relegation? More broadly, how can those with limited resources compete in a system that does not favor them? This thesis will focus on the financial and sporting strategies of England’s mid-table clubs in the past decade. In particular, this thesis will focus on the “three B’s” of the modern premier league - Brighton, Brentford, Bournemouth (smaller clubs with lower following/financial backing who have used a combination of smart recruitment and investment to challenge far above their wage bills), the “wealthy challengers” - Aston Villa and Newcastle United, the “recently victorious” - West Ham, Crystal Palace, and the “fallen giants” - Everton, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United. Profiling these clubs will illustrate the many strategies used by clubs to compete in this congested competition, and determine which profiles have been the most successful.
  
I will use financial (wage bill, transfer fees, prize money/earnings, and profit and sustainability regulations) and sporting (season to season league table position/trophies won, number of games played, and overview statistics like xG and xGA) data to build profiles of the aforementioned clubs over the last 10 years. These profiles will be the basis of comparison to determine which strategies have been overall successful, and which have not. I will note that these profiles are currently based off of media narrative/end-of-season results from the last 10 or so years - it’s not entirely clear how the data will or will not align with these binned categories.   
  
Inspired by the writings of The Athletic and books like Soccernomics, this thesis is primarily aimed at an audience interested in the business and history of soccer. Specifically, the recently-published article Mid-tier Premier League clubs and the awkward art of reinvention on the Athletic is an inspiration. While a soccer-interested audience is the main focus, this thesis will be generalized towards anyone interested in business or strategy with its focus on situations where “winning” does not guarantee sustainable, future success.
